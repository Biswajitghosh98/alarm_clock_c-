Issues : 
1)I could'nt find an equivalent of \a or \7 to make a bell sound in linux.
2)I got to know a little about threading and so,an alternate and a more better version of the same program could have been made if the same had been used. It could have freed the terminal space and it would have notified the user whenever the alarm time coincides with the given time, giving space for additional features, like adding date.
